This is a case of bad design. Here, we're looking at Williams College's Dining Services portal. This leads to this very bland webpage that sometimes even randomly links to one of the dining halls on campus. This page displays the meals planned for Driscoll dining hall. You'll see that the links to the webpage corresponding to each meal are awkwards smushed together making it difficult to distinguish each meal visually.

Clicking on breakfast we find an assortment of food categorized by fruits, starches, and entrees which is odd. None of these categories are seemingly relevent in relation with each other. The instructions for the page exist in a tiny font squished between the banner, "Nutrition @ Williams", and the table of foods available for this meal.

When you click on Fresh Fruit Salad, the website will display an image to your right of its health label. While visually unappealing, it does get the job done. However, it's unfortunate that users will have to manually close the image before clicking on another food to display its label. Clicking without closing will not change the labels automatically.
