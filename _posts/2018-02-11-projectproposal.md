## Problem and Motiviation
Fasting has certainly arrived into the mainstream in these recent years. Originally a practice found in most religions, fasting has 
been reported to have actual positive effects on the human body. With noted [benefits](https://draxe.com/benefits-fasting/) like weight 
loss, HGH secretion, and more, intermittent fasting seems like a no brainer. However, there is sometimes no clear way to document this 
process and to relate it to your health.

## Analysis of Problem
People who are doing intermittent fasting may not be documenting their health due to the rigor that one might need to have while fasting. 
As someone who has fasted in the past for Ramadan, I remember not having the strength to do the activities that I wanted. I may have 
toughed it out but I certainly did not know that I wasn't eating all of the right vitamins at the end of the day because I'd have one meal
(dinner) which limits my food intake. With a tool like this, a user would be able to avoid dizzy spells by knowing the patterns of energy 
they have during a fast. Therefore, a tool that records energy levels, food intake, and physical activity would be able to better document
this process using said information in a visually comprehensive manner.

## Proposal
An app that will allow you to track this data and display it with visual and audio information to the user. This app will have several modes corresponding to both scientific and religious methods. These will then come with preset phases of information displayed visually to 
the user on their screen with options, tips, reccomendations, and real time health tracking will completely change the way we think of our
relationship with our bodies.
