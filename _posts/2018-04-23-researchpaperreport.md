# The Design of Eco-Feedback Technology

Paper: [The Design of Eco-Feedback Technology](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1760000/1753629/p1999-froehlich.pdf?ip=137.165.169.24&id=1753629&acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&key=73B3886B1AEFC4BB%2E2C072D704A936475%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&__acm__=1525100645_812bcd1dc3172663d21025c7f6c391b2)

This paper discusses the implementation of pro-environmental technologies in Human Computer Interaction and how HCI and environmental psychology’s approach eco-feedback service. It establishes this premise on the fact that HCI researchers are not particularly self-aware of the biases they have about human nature when creating eco-feedback technology. Several models of pro-environmental behavior are listed like rational choice models which, “assume that human behavior is regulated by a systematic process of evaluating expected utility” (2000). Therefore, the resolution is to become aware of these models and for the researcher to use them to their advantage in appropriate situations. This makes sense in that perhaps a design created in an altruistic model of human behavior may not work as well in a cutthroat capitalist setting. It’s also important to think about users and how one’s design should motivate one to participate in eco-friendly behavior through usage of the final product. People may talk about the environment and its worsening condition but they may never act upon it. I agree that incentivizing one’s design in a manner that benefits the user would be one of many ways to tackle this problem. Ultimately, the paper seeks communication between the HCI and environmental and behavioral psychology camps in future studies.

This paper has made me reflect upon our initial design choice and the proceeding evolution it’s taken. Our design simply works through providing negative feedback for trash production and positive feedback for compost production in dining halls. While we do have a panel of our application dedicated to statistics over time periods, our project resides in the realm of the immediate. We know that people would like to know more about how to save the environment and we thought that simple yes and no feedback through the usage of two images that display good and bad outcomes would be sufficient. In this case, we used a norm-activation model of behavior which is based on, “the premise that moral or personal norms are direct determinants of pro-social behavior” when creating our design (2000). The statistics have to do with the direct input of the community in which we are instilling our design. Therefore, people would push to avoid the negative feedback and lean towards habits that produce positive feedback in our application so that these statistics may become favorable. In this way, our design impacts curtailment behaviors involving, “forming new routines to reduce environmental impact” (2006). Our design luckily incorporates many strategies that the paper discusses and is more robust because of it.
